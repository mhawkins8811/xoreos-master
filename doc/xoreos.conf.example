# This is an example for a xoreos.conf file, where xoreos reads and
# saves game configuration options. xoreos expects this file in the
# user conf directory, whose location depends on the operating
# system.
#
# - On GNU/Linux, the place is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xoreos/xoreos.conf.
#   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config/
# - On Mac OS X, the place is $HOME/Library/Preferences/xoreos/xoreos.conf
# - On Windows, xoreos.conf is in the subdirectory xoreos in either
#   $APPDATA or $USERPROFILE, depending on your Windows version
#
# You can also specify a different xoreos.conf with the command line
# option -c/--config.
#
# If the xoreos.conf does not exist, xoreos will create one with
# default values on the first successful game start.
#
# The encoding of this file *must* be UTF-8.
#
# When a setting is changed using the in-game menus, like the options
# menu in Neverwinter Nights, xoreos will save the changes back to the
# config file on exit, inside the section for the current game.
# Settings given on the command line are not saved back. When xoreos
# saves the config file, all unchanged settings and all comments in it
# will be preserved.
#
# The "xoreos" section is used for global configuration; the other
# sections are targets, entries to describe games. If the same setting
# exists in the global section and in the section for the current
# game, the setting in the game section overrides the global setting.
#
# The name of the game section is not used for game identification.
# As such, the name is arbitrary and up to the user. There are
# restrictions on the name, though: only these characters are allowed:
# [-_. A-Za-z0-9], i.e. alphanumerical characters plus hyphen,
# underscore, full stop and space. All section names have to be
# unique, too. Since the section name "xoreos" is already used for
# global options, it is not a valid game section name.
#
# The section names can be used to start xoreos with. This example
# file has a section called "nwn"; to start xoreos with that game, and
# automatically apply the settings in that "nwn" section (in addition
# to the global options), start xoreos with "nwn" as a command line
# option. Like so:
#
# xoreos nwn
#
# All setting keys are also valid command line options for xoreos, and
# vice versa. For example, you can start xoreos thusly:
#
# xoreos --width=800 --height=600 nwn
#
# This will start xoreos with Neverwinter Nights, with a window of
# size 800x600. These two added settings will not be saved to the
# config file. But if you then change the resolution in the options
# menu of Neverwinter Nights, xoreos will add width and height to the
# "nwn" section, with the values you selected inside the game.
#
# Moreover, if a give an option on the command line that already
# exists in the game section, it will override the setting in the game
# section, but only for this session. It will not save back to the
# config file. For example
#
# xoreos --largefonts=false nwn
#
# Will start Neverwinter Nights in xoreos with the small in-game
# conversation font, but this setting will not be remembered for the
# next time.
