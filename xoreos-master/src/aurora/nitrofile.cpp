/** @file
 *  Base class for Nitro (Nintendo DS) files.
 */

/* Most of the Nintendo DS file formats store a BOM signaling their endianness.
 * We interpret that BOM and return an appropriate SeekableSubReadStreamEndian.
 *
 * We have two ways of opening a Nitro file:
 * - The first takes a reference to a SeekableReadStream
 * - The second takes a pointer to a SeekableReadStream
 * The second one *always* takes over the original SeekableReadStream.
