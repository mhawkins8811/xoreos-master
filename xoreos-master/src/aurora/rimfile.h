/** Class to hold resource data of a RIM archive file.
 *
 *  A RIM file is a resource archive, used in several Aurora games.
 *  It is a simplified version of the more complex ERF format, lacking
 *  the support for a localized description text as found in early ERF
 *  formats, as well as compression and encryption as found in later
 *  ERF formats.
 *
 *  There is only one single version, V1.0, of the RIM format known and
 *  supported. For each resource file, it stores a path- and extension-less
 *  name (with a maximum of 16 ASCII characters) and a Type ID.
 *
 *  RIM files are found in Knights of the Old Republic, Knights of the Old
 *  Republic II and Jade Empire. They always have the .rim extension.
 *
 *  Note: .rim files in the Dragon Age games are not real RIM files.
 *        Instead, they are ERF files. See class ERFFile in erffile.h.
