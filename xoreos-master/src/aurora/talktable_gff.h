 *  See class TalkTable for a general overview how talk tables work.
 *
 *  Unlike TalkTable_TLK, a GFF talk table stores the string data
 *  within a V4.0 GFF. It does not store any language ID (the language
 *  is implicit in the talk tables file name), nor any other data
 *  besides the raw strings. getSoundResRef() always returns an empty
 *  string.
 *
 *  There are two versions of GFF'd talk tables known and supported
 *  - V0.2, used by Sonic Chronicles and Dragon Age: Origins
 *  - V0.5, used by Dragon Age II
