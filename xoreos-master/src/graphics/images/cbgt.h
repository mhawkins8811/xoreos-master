/** Loader for CBGT, BioWare's Compressed BackGround Tiles, an image
 *  format found in Sonic, used as area background images.
 *
 *  A CBGT is similar to a collection of NCGR files: cells of 64x64
 *  pixels, divided in tiles of 8x8 pixels. Each cell is compressed
 *  using Nintendo's 0x10 LZSS algorithm, though. Moreover, PAL files
 *  with the same name as the CBGT file contain the palette data, and
 *  2DA files with the same name yet again contain the mapping of
 *  palette indices onto cells.
 *
 *  The width and height of the final image is not stored within the
 *  CBGT file, but the palette mapping 2DA does contain the number
 *  cells in X and Y direction, since it stores the palette indices
 *  in a two-dimensional array of those dimensions. Therefore, multi-
 *  plying the number of columns and rows in said 2DA by 64 yields
 *  the width and height, respectively, of the final image.
